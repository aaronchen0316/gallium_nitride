# gallium_nitride
A transferable force field for gallium nitride crystal growth from the melt using on-the-fly active learning

The following files contain FLARE force field parameters for LAMMPS simulations. User need to compile LAMMPS with FLARE pair style as distributed in the FLARE codebase. For how to compile and what extra settings to use in LAMMPS, please follow: https://mir-group.github.io/flare/installation/lammps.html

- gan.flare: gallium nitride system if user need to simulate the crystallization process of wurtzite crystal from liquid gallium and gaseous nitrogen
